      "pelted door flew back upon admitting him, a quick regard- \n",
      "ful eyeing of him by all the congregation sufficiently \n",
      "attested that this fine old man was the chaplain. Yes, \n",

      "men, among whom he was a very great favourite. He \n",
      "had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for \n",
      "many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry. \n",

      "sleet, and his great pilot-cloth jacket seemed almost to \n",

      "absorbed. However, hat and coat and overshoes were \n",

      "Like most old-fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, \n",
      "and since a regular stairs to such a height would, by its \n",
      "long angle with the floor, seriously contract the already \n",
      "small area of the chapel, the architect, it seemed, had \n",
      "acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and finished the \n",
      "pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side \n",
      "ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at \n",
      "sea. The wife of a whaling-captain had provided the chapel \n",
      "with a handsome pair of red worsted man-ropes for this \n",
      "ladder, which, being itself nicely headed, and stained with \n",
      "a mahogany colour, the whole contrivance, considering \n",
      "what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad \n",
      "taste. Halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder, \n",
      "and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs \n",
      "of the man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upward, \n",
      "and then with a truly sailor-like but still reverential \n",
      "dexterity, hand over hand, mounted the steps as if \n",
      "ascending the main -top of his vessel. \n",
      "\n",
      "The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually \n",
      "the case with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, \n",
      "only the rounds were of wood, so that at every step there \n",
      "was a joint. At my first glimpse of the pulpit, it had not \n",
      "escaped me that however convenient for a ship, these \n",

      "suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of \n",

      "the time, from all outward worldly ties and connections ? \n",
      "Yes, for replenished with the meat and wine of the word, \n",

      "perennial well of water within the walls. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the side ladder was not the only strange feature \n",
      "of the place, borrowed from the chaplain's former sea- \n",
      "farings. Between the marble cenotaphs on either hand \n",

      "with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating \n",
      "against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and \n",
      "snowy breakers. But high above the flying scud and \n",
      "dark-rolling clouds, there floated a little isle of sunlight, \n",
      "from which beamed forth an angel's face ; and this bright \n",
      "face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ship's tossed \n",
      "deck, something like that silver plate now inserted into the \n",
      "Victory's plank where Nelson fell. ' Ah, noble ship/ the \n",
      "angel seemed to say, 'beat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and \n",

      "the clouds are rolling off serenest azure is at hand.' \n",

      "Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same \n",

      "toward the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it were \n",
      "the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the midst of \n",
      "this consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, \n",
      "and crawling under the path of the boom, whipped hold \n",

      "would not be very large ; but considering that I was used \n",
      "to the sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, \n",
      "I made no doubt that from all I had heard I should be \n",
      "offered at least the 275th lay that is, the 275th part of \n",
      "the clear nett proceeds of the voyage, whatever that \n",
      "might eventually amount to. And though the 275th \n",
      "lay was what they call a rather long lay, yet it was better \n",
      "than nothing ; and if we had a lucky voyage, might \n",
      "pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it, \n",
      "not to speak of my three years' beef and board, for which \n",

      "It might be thought that this was a poor way to \n",

      "about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the world \n",
      "is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at \n",
      "this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I \n",
      "thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, \n",

      "the 200th, considering I was of a broad-shouldered make. \n",
      "\n",
      "But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little \n",

      "fore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered \n",

      "as twice-baked biscuit. Transported to the Indies, his \n",
      "live blood would not spoil like bottled ale. He must have \n",
      "been born in some time of general drought and famine, \n",
      "or upon one of those fast days for which his state is \n",
      "famous. Only some thirty arid summers had he seen ; \n",
      "those summers had dried up all his physical superfluous- \n",
      "ness. But this, his thinness, so to speak, seemed no more \n",
      "the token of wasting anxieties and cares, than it seemed \n",
      "the indication of any bodily blight. It was merely the \n",
      "condensation of the man. He was by no means ill-look- \n",
      "ing ; quite the contrary. His pure tight skin was an \n",

      "reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his life did there- \n",

      "rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than from \n",
      "ignorance. Outward portents and inward presentiments \n",

      "memories of his young Cape wife and child tend to bend \n",

      "to a certain superstitiousness, as has been said ; the \n",
      "courage of this Starbuck which could, nevertheless, still \n",
      "flourish, must indeed have been extreme. But it was not \n",
      "in reasonable nature that a man so organised, and with \n",
      "such terrible experiences and remembrances as he had ; \n",

      "infinity of firmest fortitude, a determinate, unsurrender- \n",
      "able wilfulness, in the fixed and fearless, forward dedi- \n",

      "his officers say aught to him ; though by all their minutest \n",
      "gestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, \n",
      "if not painful, consciousness of being under a troubled \n",

      "or seated upon an ivory stool he had ; or heavily walking \n",

      "with these visible hands ; I am in earnest ; and I will \n",
      "try. There are some preliminaries to settle. \n",
      "\n",
      "First : The uncertain, unsettled condition of this \n",
      "science of Cetology is in the very vestibule attested by \n",
      "the fact, that in some quarters it still remains a moot point \n",
      "whether a whale be a fish. In his System of Nature, \n",
      "A.D. 1776, Linnaeus declares, ' I hereby separate the whales \n",
      "from the fish. 5 But of my own knowledge, I know that \n",
      "down to the year 1850, sharks and shad, ale wives and \n",
      "herring, against Linnaeus 's express edict, were still found \n",
      "dividing the possession of the same seas with the leviathan. \n",
      "\n",
      "The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have \n",
      "banished the whales from the waters, he states as follows : \n",
      "' On account of their warm bilocular heart, their lungs, \n",
      "their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem intrantem \n",
      "feminam mammis lactantem,' and finally, ' ex lege naturae \n",
      "jure meritoque.' I submitted all this to my friends \n",
      "Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nantucket, both \n",
      "messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and they united \n",
      "in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether \n",
      "insufficient . Charley profanely hinted they were humbug . \n",
      "\n",
      "Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good \n",
      "old-fashioned ground that the whale is a fish, and call \n",
      "upon holy Jonah to back me. This fundamental thing \n",
      "settled, the next point is, in what internal respect does \n",
      "the whale differ from other fish. Above, Linnaeus has \n",
      "given you those items. But in brief, they are those : \n",
      "lungs and warm blood ; whereas, all other fish are lung- \n",
      "less and cold-blooded. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next : how shall we define the whale, by his obvious \n",
      "externals, so as conspicuously to label him for all time to \n",
      "come ? To be short, then, a whale is a spouting fish with \n",
      "a horizontal tail. There you have him. However con- \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "168 MOBY-DICK \n",
      "\n",
      "traded, that definition is the result of expanded medita- \n",
      "tion. A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus \n",
      "is not a fish, because he is amphibious. But the last term \n",
      "of the definition is still more cogent, as coupled with the \n",
      "first. Almost any one must have noticed that all the \n",
      "fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a vertical, \n",
      "or up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the \n",
      "tail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes \n",
      "a horizontal position. \n",
      "\n",
      "By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no \n",
      "means exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea- \n",
      "creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best- \n",
      "informed Nantucketers ; nor, on the other hand, link \n",
      "with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien. 1 \n",
      "Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal-tailed fish \n",
      "must be included in this ground-plan of Cetology. Now, \n",
      "then, come the grand divisions of the entire whale host. \n",

      "Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, \n",
      "maned sea-lion on the white coral beach, surrounded by \n",
      "his warlike but still deferential cubs. In his own proper \n",
      "turn, each officer waited to be served. They were as \n",
      "little children before Ahab ; and yet, in Ahab, there \n",
      "seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance. With \n",

      "that moment with the slightest observation, even upon \n",
      "so neutral a topic as the weather. No ! And when \n",
      "reaching out his knife and fork, between which the slice \n",
      "of beef was locked, Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck's \n",
      "plate toward him, the mate received his meat as though \n",
      "receiving alms ; and cut it tenderly ; and a little started \n",
      "if, perchance, the knife grazed against the plate ; and \n",
      "chewed it noiselessly ; and swallowed it, not without \n",

      "Frankfort, where the German Emperor profoundly dines \n",
      "with the seven Imperial Electors, so these cabin meals \n",
      "were somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence ; and \n",

      "miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper cruising- \n",
      "ground. And if, after a three, four, or five years' voyage \n",
      "she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her \n",

      "Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or \n",

      "though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must \n",

      "loftiest mast-head in all Asia, or Africa either ; yet (ere \n",
      "the final truck was put to it) as that great stone mast of \n",
      "theirs may be said to have gone by the board, in the dread \n",
      "gale of God's wrath ; therefore, we cannot give these \n",

      "summit, hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle ; \n",
      "in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless \n",
      "stander of mast-heads ; who was not to be driven from \n",
      "his place by fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet ; but vali- \n",
      "antly facing everything out to the last, literally died at \n",

      "ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of \n",

      "that broad madness, not one jot of his great natural \n",
      "intellect had perished. That before living agent, now \n",

      "in which at these times he is said to swim, generally \n",

      "\n",
      "And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well- \n",

      "taken place ; there the waves were storied with his deeds ; \n",
      "there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old \n",
      "man had found the awful motive to his vengeance. But \n",
      "in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigi- \n",

      "ture hour of the Pequod's sailing had, perhaps, been \n",
      "correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this very com- \n",
      "plexion of things. Because, an interval of three hundred \n",
      "and sixty-five days and nights was before him ; an inter- \n",

      "savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with all the other \n",
      "common perils incident to wandering in the heart of un- \n",

      "with the respective marks cut in them, afterward taken \n",

      "out that I was in the boat both times, first and last, and \n",
      "the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge \n",

      "First : In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain \n",
      "Pollard, of Nantucket, was cruising in the Pacific Ocean. \n",
      "One day she saw spouts, lowered her boats, and gave chase \n",
      "to a shoal of sperm whales. Ere long, several of the \n",

      "who was chief mate of the Essex at the time of the tragedy ; \n",

      "conversed with his son ; and all this within a few miles \n",
      "of the scene of the catastrophe. 1 \n",

      "Secondly : The ship Union, also of Nantucket, was in \n",
      "the year 1 807 totally lost off the Azores by a similar onset, \n",
      "but the authentic particulars of this catastrophe I have \n",

      "at a short interval between them, both of which, according to their \n",

      "and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the shook ; to \n",
      "effect which, the exact manoeuvres which he made were necessary. His \n",
      "aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated resentment and fury. He \n",
      "came directly from the shoal which we had just before entered, and in \n",
      "which we had struck three of his companions, as if fired with revenge for \n",
      "their sufferings.' Again : ' At all events, the whole circumstances taken \n",
      "together, all happening before my own eyes, and producing, at the time, \n",
      "impressions in my mind of decided, calculating mischief, on the part of \n",
      "the whale (many of which impressions I cannot now recall), induce me to \n",
      "be satisfied that I am correct in my opinion.' \n",

      "Here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during a \n",

      "Then, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lace- \n",

      "is out of sight, like a launched line-of-battle ship ; and \n",
      "out of that element it is a thing eternally impossible for \n",

      "similar scenes elsewhere presented, I have here to speak \n",
      "of the magical, sometimes horrible whale-line. \n",
      "\n",
      "The line originally used in the fishery was of the best \n",
      "hemp, slightly vapoured with tar, not impregnated with \n",
      "it, as in the case of ordinary ropes ; for while tar, as \n",
      "ordinarily used, makes the hemp more pliable to the rope- \n",
      "maker, and also renders the rope itself more convenient \n",
      "to the sailor for common ship use ; yet, not only would \n",
      "the ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale-line for \n",
      "the close coiling to which it must be subjected ; but as \n",
      "most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in general by \n",
      "no means adds to the rope's durability or strength, how- \n",
      "ever much it may give it compactness and gloss. \n",
      "\n",
      "Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American \n",
      "fishery almost entirely superseded hemp as a material \n",
      "for whale-lines ; for, though not so durable as hemp, it \n",
      "is stronger, and far more soft and elastic ; and I will add \n",
      "(since there is an aesthetics in all things), is much more \n",
      "handsome and becoming to the boat, than hemp. Hemp \n",
      "is a dusky, dark fellow, a sort of Indian ; but Manilla \n",
      "is as a golden-haired Circassian to behold. \n",
      "\n",
      "The whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness. \n",
      "At first sight, you would not think it so strong as it really \n",

      "that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three \n",
      "tons. In length, the common sperm whale-line measures \n",
      "something over two hundred fathoms. Toward the \n",
      "stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub, not \n",
      "like the worm-pipe of a still though, but so as to form one \n",
      "round, cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded 'sheaves,' \n",
      "or layers of concentric spiralisations, without any hollow \n",

      "coiling would, in running out, infallibly take somebody's \n",
      "arm, leg, or entire body off, the utmost precaution is \n",
      "used in stowing the line in its tub. Some harpooneers \n",
      "will consume almost an entire morning in this business, \n",
      "carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downward \n",

      "\n",
      "In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one ; \n",
      "the same line being continuously coiled in both tubs. \n",
      "There is some advantage in this ; because these twin -tubs \n",
      "being so small they fit more readily into the boat, and do \n",
      "not strain it so much ; whereas, the American tub, nearly \n",
      "three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth, makes \n",
      "a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but \n",
      "one half-inch in thickness ; for the bottom of the whale- \n",
      "boat is like critical ice, which will bear up a considerable \n",
      "distributed weight, but not very much of a concentrated \n",

      "like a mug of ale, as it were, from the one boat to the \n",
      "other ; though the first boat always hovers at hand to \n",

      "pensable for common safety's sake ; for were the lower \n",
      "end of the line in any way attached to the boat, and were \n",
      "the whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a \n",
      "single, smoking minute as he sometimes does, he would \n",
